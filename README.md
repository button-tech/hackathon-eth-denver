# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
That's a secure messenger client to make transactions which is super easy to use. You don't need to download anything and you can send transactions via @nickname. We were inspired by WeChat payments. We build it not only on ETH but also on BTC and second layer of ETH called Celer Network. That's mean - very low fees and fast payments!

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
We use NodeJs, Redis, MongoDB and JS on the Frontend and Golang microservice

# Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)

# All Bounties Completed/Incorporated
Rhombus Network - We use exchange rate from ETH to USD and BTC to USD to send crypto.
Celer Network - We use payment channel.
ShapeShift - We allow users to make a swap from BTC to ETC and back
